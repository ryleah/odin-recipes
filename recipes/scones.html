    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Whether it is a special occasion or just another Tuesday, I don't see any reason why the day shouldn't start off with a warm chocolate scone. It's a fast and simple way to make any morning special, with or without an official excuse to do so. While it's strangely difficult to find a good scone these days (store-bought versions always seem so dry), they're freakishly simple to make at home.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>9 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 cups, spooned; 255g), plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight</li>
            <li>2 ounces cold unsalted butter (4 tablespoons; 55g), cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>6 ounces roughly chopped milk chocolate (1 cup; 170g)</li>
            <li>2 ounces milk (1/4 cup; 55g), any percentage will do</li>
            <li>6 ounces heavy cream (3/4 cup; 170g)</li>
            <li>Toasted or turbinado sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>Sift flour into a medium bowl, then whisk in baking powder, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add butter and toss to break up the pieces, then smash each one flat between your fingertips. Continue smashing and rubbing until butter disappears into a coarse meal. </li>
            <li>Add milk chocolate and toss to combine, then stir in milk and cream to form a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a 7-inch round. Cut into 6 wedges with a chef’s knife, sprinkle generously with toasted or turbinado sugar, and arrange on a parchment-lined half sheet pan.</li>
            <li>Bake until puffed and golden, about 25 minutes. If you like, serve with clotted cream and strawberry jam, or a spoonful of super-thick and fruity whipped cream.</li>
        </ol>
